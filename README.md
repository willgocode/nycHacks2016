Our program for HackNY2016. 

Our program will suggest a random event from our personal recommendations and present
it to the user as a 'Mission'. 

If that isn't interesting for the user, they will also be able to check out fun things to do nearby using the Foursquare API. 

If that still isn't interesting enough for the user, they can perform a Foursquare search directly from our app using the API.

So the goal of this app is an amazing integrated hub for anyone that is looking
for fun things to do in the Big Apple!
